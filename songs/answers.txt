If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
how would you characterize their audio aura? I would do sentiments analysis on the title of the songs,
giving the average a weight of 2,  then I'd look at the average energy, valence, and danceability with a weight
of 3, 3, 2 respectively.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not
be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
My selection of weight are purely based on how I feel. A more accurate method would be to poll the lyrics
from an external source and then perform sentiment analysis on that data alone.
