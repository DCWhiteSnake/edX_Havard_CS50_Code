Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
France's chances of winning decreased the more I increase the number of simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 10000 simulations. Why? Because
when at this number of simulations I get an average case scenerio and am able to optimize for both
cost and accuracy.
